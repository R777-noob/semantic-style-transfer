# semantic-style-transfer
 :art: :art:
Tensorflow implementation of semantic style transfer based on guided Gram Matrices
Say that it uses the slow model (imqge optimisation problem)

In construction...

## Examples

## Implementation Details

## Installation
Say that is pretty easy( no need to recomplie the project)
Copy this repository using the git clone
Configure a new project using a python IDE (say that I personnaly use Pycharm), useful to debugg
Configure project interpreter (chose the virtual env)

```
git clone https://github.com/nicolastah/semantic-style-transfer
```

### Dependencies
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/installation.html#installation)
- CUDA (GPU) -- Recommended
- CUDNN (GPU) -- Recommended

I recommend creating **isolated Python environments** using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). **Vital** to **avoid dependencies conflicts** when working on different projects. For those who are not familiar with Virtualenv, here are 2 tutorials that should help you get started, [tuto1](http://thepythonguru.com/python-virtualenv-guide/) and [tuto2](http://www.simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial-part-2/). Lastly, I' m using [Ubuntu16.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), but the code should run on Windows and macOs.


### Model Weigths
Recall that Â style transfer is based on perceptual losses. Thoses losses, based on high level features representation, allows to separate style and content. As in the [orignal work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), we have used a [VGG19](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/beta16/imagenet-vgg-very) pretrained on image classification.

### Speed
Talk about the speed with GPU. Do it with different mage size (similar as Titus). Then do the same without GPU. Say that it is also possbile but it is slower
Can use emojie here, turtle = slow (cpu), rabbit = fast (gpu)

## Usage
### Full Transfer
Show how to run the code
Say how to pgive param script using pycharm
Put link to titu Kera implementation, say that can check his work for the tips

### Semantic Transfer
Show how to run the code
Explain guidance guided matrices = semantic mask
Can put some links to some semantic segmentation algorithms
Explain how to put the mask in my programm

- Guided Gram Matrices is based on Gatys' paper [Controlling Perceptual Factors in Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07865)
- Our implementation is based on [anishathalye/neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style)
- Our work is an implement of XX
