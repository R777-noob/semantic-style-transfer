# semantic-style-transfer
Tensorflow implementation of semantic style transfer based on guided Gram Matrices

In construction...

## Usage

### Full Transfer
Show how to run the code

### Semantic Transfer

## Setup
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/installation.html#installation)
- CUDA (GPU) -- Recommended
- CUDNN (GPU) -- Recommended

I recommend using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Python (useful to avoid dependencies conflicts when working on different projects).

## Acknowledgement
- Guided Gram Matrices is based on Gatys' paper [Controlling Perceptual Factors in Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07865)
- Our implementation is based on [anishathalye/neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style)
- Our work is an implement of XX
