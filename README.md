# semantic-style-transfer
Tensorflow implementation of semantic style transfer based on guided Gram Matrices

In construction...

## Usage

### Full Transfer
Show how to run the code

### Semantic Transfer

## Setup
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/installation.html#installation)
- CUDA (GPU) -- Recommended
- CUDNN (GPU) -- Recommended

I recommend creating **isolated Python environments** using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). **Vital** to **avoid dependencies conflicts** when working on different projects. Here are 2 tutorials that should help you get started, [tuto1](http://thepythonguru.com/python-virtualenv-guide/) and [tuto2](http://www.simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial-part-2/).

## Speed
Talk about the speed with GPU. Do it with different mage size (similar as Titus). Then do the same without GPU. Say that it is also possbile but it is slower

## Acknowledgement
- Guided Gram Matrices is based on Gatys' paper [Controlling Perceptual Factors in Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07865)
- Our implementation is based on [anishathalye/neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style)
- Our work is an implement of XX
